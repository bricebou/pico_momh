Pico-momh
=========

A simple and basic theme for Pico CMS with a basic responsive support for my website [momh.fr](http://momh.fr/).

It will be extended gradually, accordingly to my needs.

For this project I use SASS for the first time, and very basically; no doubt that I can improve myself in its use  and still discover a lot.

## Content structure

You can check how the contents are organized on my website on my [momh_content
 repository](https://github.com/bricebou/momh_content).
